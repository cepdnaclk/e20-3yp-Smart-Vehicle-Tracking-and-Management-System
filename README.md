**"The Smart Way to Drive"**

![Project Banner](docs/images/project-logo.jpg)

## Introduction

The **Smart Vehicle Tracking and Management System** leverages cutting-edge IoT and sensor technologies to enhance vehicle safety and operational efficiency. It integrates real-time tracking, accident detection, and notifications for unauthorized disconnections, ensuring comprehensive vehicle and cargo management. Combining GPS, GSM, accelerometer, and cloud solutions, the system addresses critical challenges in the transportation sector.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Vehicle Tracking:** Monitor vehicle locations with precision.
- **Accident Detection:** Instantly alerts administrators in the event of an accident.
- **Unauthorized Disconnection Alerts:** Notifies on tampering or unauthorized device disconnections.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Tracks cargo temperature and humidity.
- **Administrative Control:** Features an admin panel for efficient vehicle and data management.

## Problem Statement

Current vehicle management systems often lack affordable, comprehensive solutions for real-time tracking and operational management. This project bridges that gap, improving safety, efficiency, and decision-making for cargo operations.

## Solution Architecture

The system is built around a robust combination of hardware and software:
